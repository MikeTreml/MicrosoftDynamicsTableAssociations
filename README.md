# Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 and Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations Table Associations
This project allows you to find the relations between tables in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 and Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. 

It utilizes the ERD information provided by Microsoft which I host at: <a href="https://alexdmeyer.com/ax2012erd/">https://alexdmeyer.com/ax2012erd</a>.

This solution can be used for both AX 2012 and D365FO as the table structures for both applications are similar.
